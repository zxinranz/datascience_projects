# Yelp Data Analysis
> By Noora Zhou
## Introduction
**Yelp** is an online platform that allows users to search for and browse information about businesses, including their address, phone number, hours of operation, and other details. It also enables users to view reviews and ratings of businesses written by other users, and to write and publish their own reviews and comments. Yelp's review system leverages the power of social networking, encouraging users to share their experiences and opinions about businesses, which helps other users to find better businesses. Yelp was founded in 2004 in the United States and has expanded to other countries including Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland, among others.<br>

**The Yelp dataset** is a collection of data related to businesses, reviews, users, and other interactions on the Yelp platform. The dataset includes information from several cities across the United States, covering a variety of business categories and user demographics.
The purpose of this dataset is to enable researchers, data analysts, and data scientists to explore and analyze the dynamics of the Yelp platform and gain insights into user behavior, business performance, and market trends. With the increasing popularity of online review platforms like Yelp, this dataset provides a valuable resource for understanding the factors that influence customer satisfaction, business success, and platform growth.
